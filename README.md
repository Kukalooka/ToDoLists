# To Do List App!

I took on this project because not only do I think it will be useful, I also want to strengthen my Node knowledge and derust after taking a break from coding for a while. 

I just started this project so there's pretty much nothing here yet, so stay tuned for updates!

## Things that need to be done:
- Change things like database connection data from localhost stuff to env variables
- Frontend... like all of it
- Ensuring that usernames are unique
- Creating lists and updating them on the backend
- After database structure is finished, some kind of script that will automatically recreated it for anyone who wants to run this for themselves
