# To Do List App!

I took on this project because not only do I think it will be useful, I also want to strengthen my Node knowledge and derust after taking a break from coding for a while. 

I just started this project so there's pretty much nothing here yet, so stay tuned for updates!

## Things that need to be done:

- Frontend... like all of it
- Creating lists and updating them on the backend
- Finish Database Structure

## Run Instructions

Clone "template.env", rename it to ".env", populate all of the fields there and then run the program with `npm start`
