# To Do List App!

I took on this project because not only do I think it will be useful, I also want to strengthen my Node knowledge and derust after taking a break from coding for a while. 

The project is slowly unraveling but it ain't done yet!

## Things that need to be done:

- Frontend... like all of it
- Creating list elements and fetching them based on user's id

## Run Instructions

Clone "template.env", rename it to ".env", populate all of the fields there and then run the program with `npm start`
